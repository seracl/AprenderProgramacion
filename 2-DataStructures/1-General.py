Data Structures are the programmatic way of storing data so that data can be used efficiently.
Almost every enterprise application uses various types of data structures in one or the other way.

Algorithm is a step-by-step procedure, which defines a set of instructions to be 
	executed in a certain order to get the desired output. 
	Algorithms are generally created independent of underlying languages, i.e. 
		an algorithm can be implemented in more than one programming language.

## Why to Learn Data Structure and Algorithms?
As applications are getting complex and data rich. Which carry some problems:
- Data Search
- Processor speed: Processor speed although being very high, falls limited if the data grows to billion records.
- Multiplr requests

To solve the above-mentioned problem, data can be organized in such a way
	that items might be searched instantly

## Applications of Data Structure and Algorithms
Categories of algorithms, from the data structure point of view:
- Search
- Sort
- Insert
- Update
- Delete
The following problems ca
