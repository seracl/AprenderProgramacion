Almost every enterprise application uses various types of data structures in one or the other way.
That's why is essential that data is stored efficiently, can be fast accessed,  
Also processing of should happen in the smallest amount of time and without losing accuracy.

Why to Learn Data Structure and Algorithms?: As applications are getting complex and data rich, some problems arise:
	- Data Search: As data grows, search will become slower.
	- Processor speed: Processor speed although being very high, falls limited as the data grows.
	- Multiple requests: As number of users raise, servers will fail if not incremented.
	To solve the above-mentioned problem, data can be organized in such a way that items might be searched instantly

Applications of Data Structure and Algorithms: The following computer problems can be solved using Data Structures
	- Fibonacci number series
	- Knapsack problem
	- Tower of Hanoi
	- All pair shortest path by Floyd-Warshall
	- Shortest path by Dijkstra
	- Project scheduling

Data Structure:
	- Data structures deal with how the data is organized and held in the memory when a program processes it.
	- Data structures are fundamental concepts of computer science which helps is writing efficient programs in any language.

Algorithm:
	- An Algorithm is step by step set of instruction to process the data for a specific purpose. 
	- So an algorithm utilizes various data structures in a logical way to solve a specific computing problem.
