## Data Structures
"""
Data Structures: Programmatic way of storing data so that data can be used efficiently.

Data structures foundation terms:
	- Interface: Each data structure has an interface, or set of operations, accepted parameters and return types that a data structure supports. 
	- Implementation: Implementation provides the internal representation and the definition of the algorithms used in the operations of the data structure. 

Characteristics of a Data Structure
	- Correctness: Data structure implementation should implement its interface correctly.
	- Time Complexity: Running time or the execution time of operations of data structure must be as small as possible.
	- Space Complexity: Memory usage of a data structure operation should be as little as possible.

Execution Time Cases: Used to compare data structure's relative execution time (f(n) execution time in function of the f(data) ).
	- Worst Case: Maximum amount of time a data structure operation time can take. 
		In worst case, operations won't take more than ƒ(n) time where ƒ(n) represents function of n.
	- Average Case: Average execution time of an operation of a data structure. 
		If an operation takes ƒ(n) time in execution, then m operations will take m*ƒ(n) time.
	- Best Case: An operation's least possible execution time.
		If execution takes ƒ(n) time, then the actual operation may take time as the random number with ƒ(n) maximum time.

# Data definition and data object 
"""
Data Definition defines a particular data with the following characteristics.
	- Atomic: Definition should define a single concept.
	- Traceable: Definition should be able to be mapped to some data element.
	- Accurate: Definition should be unambiguous.
	- Clear and Concise: Definition should be understandable.

Data Object represents an object having a data.
"""

# Data types
"""
Data type is a way to classify types of data from which the values and the operations to be performed must correspond to  
	- Built-in Data Type
	- Derived Data Type

Built-in Data Type
	Data types for which a language has built-in support.
		- Integers
		- Boolean (true, false)
		- Floating (Decimal numbers)
		- Character and Strings

Derived Data Type
	Data types that are implementation independent as they are the result of built-in data types and associated operations on them.
		- List
		- Array
		- Stack
		- Queue

Basic Operations 
	The data structure chosen depends on the frequency of the operation to be performed on it.
		- Traversing
		- Searching
		- Insertion
		- Deletion
		- Sorting
		- Merging
