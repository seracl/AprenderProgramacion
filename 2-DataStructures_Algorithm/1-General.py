# Data Structure and Algorithms

https://www.tutorialspoint.com/data_structures_algorithms/data_structures_basics.htm
Almost every enterprise application uses various types of data structures in one or the other way.

Why to Learn Data Structure and Algorithms?: As applications are getting complex and data rich, some problems arise:
	- Data Search: As data grows, search will become slower.
	- Processor speed: Processor speed although being very high, falls limited as the data grows.
	- Multiple requests: As number of users raise, servers will fail if not incremented.
	To solve the above-mentioned problem, data can be organized in such a way that items might be searched instantly

Applications of Data Structure and Algorithms: The following computer problems can be solved using Data Structures
	- Fibonacci number series
	- Knapsack problem
	- Tower of Hanoi
	- All pair shortest path by Floyd-Warshall
	- Shortest path by Dijkstra
	- Project scheduling
